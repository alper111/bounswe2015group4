# Summary #

Our project is about creating a social network for people in Bogazici University CmpE department. It will be a closed system in which people can create their own profile pages and can share their interest topics. Users will also be able to create interest groups and events. There will be an android application and a website for this social network project.


# Background #

The application will be only for people who are somehow related to Bogazici University Computer Engineering Department. Users will register into the system with their roles in the department which are undergraduate, graduate, alumni, faculty member, teaching assistant, research assistant and support staff.

The main goal is to enable members to contact each other in an easier and faster way. Therefore, there will be profile pages of members, events, interest groups, content creating and sharing and such other properties.

Privacy will be important. A member will be able to follow another member if she/he allows. Almost any item will have option for privacy. People will choose to whom they want to share.
